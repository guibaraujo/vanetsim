## **VANETSIM**
> It is an open-source framework for IVC (inter-vehicle communication) simulations in more realistic road traffic mobility scenarios.

> VANETSIM is based on simulators: [Ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/), an open-source discrete-event network simulator, and [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) (Simulation of Urban MObility), a microscopic and continuous multi-modal traffic simulation. 

> The framework permits a bidirectional communication between ns3, and SUMO to evaluate better applications, services, and improved IVC analysis for ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) context.
